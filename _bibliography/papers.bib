  abstract={Online Social Networks (OSNs) attracted millions of
users in the world. OSNs made adversaries more passionate to
create malware variants to subvert the cyber defence of OSNs.
Through various threat vectors, adversaries persuasively lure
OSN users into installing malware on their devices at an enormous
scale. One of the most horrendous forms of named malware is
OSNs' botnets that conceal C&C information using OSNs'
accounts of unaware users. In this paper, we present GITC (Ghost
In The Cloud), which uses Telegram as a C&C server to
communicate with threat actors and access targets' information in
an undetectable way. Furthermore, we present our
implementation of GITC. We show how GITC uses the encrypted
telegram Application Programming Interface (API) to cover up
records of the adversary connections to the target, and we discuss
why current intrusion detection systems cannot detect GITC. In
the end, we run some sets of experiments that confirm the
feasibility of GITC.}

  abstract={Creating games is a costly process involving tons of vigorous efforts, time, and resources. Different game engines were introduced to facilitate the game-making process, such as Unreal Engine, Unity, and Godot. However, despite the advent of game engines, the vacuum of automatically creating new games by computers was still felt. With artificial intelligence (AI) development and its growing presence in the industry, game developers made a new game development branch using AI. One of the essential steps in this context was the introduction of GameGAN, which inspired us for this article. Here we propose Multi-Class GamgeGan(MC-GAN), a starting point for the next generation of game engines based on GameGAN. In addition, MC-GAN is capable of classifying each desired game element and even changing its class to change the element's nature (e.g., MC-GAN can change static elements to dynamic ones …}

  abstract={In the current world, the Internet is being used almost everywhere. With the rise of IoT technology, which is one of the most used technologies, billions of IoT devices are interconnected over the Internet. However, DoS/DDoS attacks are the most frequent and perilous threat to this growing technology. New types of DDoS attacks are highly advanced and complicated, and it is almost impossible to detect or mitigate by the existing intrusion detection systems and traditional methods. Fortunately, Big Data, Data mining, and Machine Learning technologies make it possible to detect DDoS traffic effectively. This paper suggests a DDoS detection model based on data mining and machine learning techniques. For writing this paper, the latest available Dataset, CICDDoS2019, experimented with the most popular machine learning algorithms and specified the most correlated features with predicted classes are being used. It is discovered that AdaBoost and XGBoost were extraordinarily accurate and correctly predicted the type of network traffic with 100% accuracy. Future research can be extended by enhancing the model for multiclassification of different DDoS attack types and testing hybrid algorithms and newer datasets on this model.}

  abstract={Learning was always an essential part of our lives
to acquire knowledge and move forward. However, the
increasing wages of on-campus learning leads to an increasing
need for an alternate way of learning. With the outbreak of
COVID-19, people needed to stay at home for safety. Therefore,
finding an answer to this need became more dominant. Another
major problem, especially in the ongoing decade, is the lack of
enough cybersecurity knowledge by the common folk. This
paper aims to look at a new platform that is carefully designed
to teach cybersecurity to learners with any background. We
design this system using gamification to increase the efficiency
of learning. Because modern technologies are ubiquitous in our
lives, particularly during the coronavirus outbreak, including
practical work in teaching will be quite beneficial. The practical
activity has a clear advantage, such as promoting experimental
learning and improving student abilities and skills for the future
professional career. Finally, we assess this method with a classic
learning approach using two different groups.}

  abstract={One of the most promising applications of the IoT is the Smart Grid (SG). Integrating SG's data communications network into the power grid allows for gathering and analyzing information from power lines, distribution power stations, and end users. A smart grid (SG) requires a fast and dependable connection to provide real-time monitoring through the IoT. Hence 5G could be considered a catalyst for upgrading the existing power grid systems. Nonetheless, the additional attack surface of information infrastructure has been brought about by the widespread adoption of ubiquitous connectivity in 5G, to which the typical information security system in the smart grid cannot respond promptly. Therefore, guaranteeing the Privacy and Security of a network in a threatening, ever-changing environment requires groundbreaking architectures that go well beyond the limitations of traditional, static security measures. With" Continuous Identity Authentication and Dynamic Access Control" as its foundation, this article analyzes the Zero Trust (ZT) architecture specific to the power system of IoT and uses that knowledge to develop a security protection architecture.}

  abstract={Using dispersed data and training, federated learning (FL) moves AI capabilities to edge devices or does tasks locally. Many consider FL the start of a new era in AI, yet it is still immature. FL has not garnered the community's trust since its security and privacy implications are controversial. FL's security and privacy concerns must be discovered, analyzed, and recorded before widespread usage and adoption. A solid comprehension of risk variables allows an FL practitioner to construct a secure environment and provide researchers with a clear perspective of potential study fields, making FL the best solution in situations where security and privacy are primary issues. This research aims to deliver a complete overview of FL's security and privacy features to help bridge the gap between current federated AI and broad adoption in the future. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of the attack surface to investigate FL's existing challenges and defense measures to evaluate its robustness and reliability. According to our study, security concerns regarding FL are more frequent than privacy issues. Communication bottlenecks, poisoning, and backdoor attacks represent FL's privacy's most significant security threats. In the final part, we detail future research that will assist FL in adapting to real-world settings.}
